Data Analysis Extravaganza: A Worldwide Sales and Orders Odyssey

Mission Briefing:
Prepare yourself for an exhilarating dive into the ocean of data as we embark on a grand adventure to analyze sales and orders data from nooks and crannies around the globe. Your tools? API calls sharper than a double-edged sword and Excel files thicker than a mystery novel!

Quests to Conquer:

API Shenanigans:

Your Targets:

Orders API: Master the ancient scrolls of the Orders API (https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/orders-api-v0-reference) to summon order details from the digital ether.

Sales API: Channel the arcane powers of the Sales API(https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sales-api-v1-reference)  to reveal the mysteries of sales data.

Stealth Mode: Engage in covert operations to make API calls. Remember, the keys to the kingdom (API keys, that is) must remain unseen by prying eyes across different realms (regions).

Treasure Hunt (Data Retrieval and Setup):
Maps - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X9nCy4mvgAXjzvpqCzQw28S5FQS7IEuO?usp=sharing

Download treasure maps (XLS files) leading to the rich lands of Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Each map is filled with cryptic symbols and numbers representing sales lore (columns like Date/Time, Order ID, SKU, and more).

Data Alchemy (Cleaning and Preprocessing):
Transmute chaotic date formats into a single, golden standard.
Banish the dark spirits of null values and duplicate entries with your powerful data-cleansing spells.

Epic Saga of Analysis (Data Analysis and Reporting):
Combine all treasure maps into one legendary artifact (a single comprehensive file).
Determine which kingdom (country) hoards the most gold (sales) and identify the mightiest region within that kingdom.
Travel through time with comparisons of months and years to uncover patterns of wealth and woe.
Investigate the curious case of disappearing gold (refunds). Are some treasures cursed (higher refunds for certain products)?


Expected Booty:

A treasure chest (consolidated dataset) brimming with polished data jewels ready for analysis.
A scroll (report) detailing your heroic deeds with charts as colorful as a bard's tales, comparing the riches across different lands and eras.
Wise insights into the enigmatic patterns of refunds, complete with sage advice on enhancing the market's offerings and customer joy.
Dive into this quest with the vigor of a knight, the precision of an archer, and the wisdom of a wizard. May your data points always be accurate, and your graphs never be pie-lies!
